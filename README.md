The same code works with rasberry pi. 

To have a error free data storage do the following steps:
Download the json library version 15.13.1

as specified by @adamrabbani 
try use old libary for a while..
This link --> https://github.com/RaemondBW/firebase-arduino

but this library doesn't work for stream function
just simple function like "get" and "set" is work.

download and edit to newest fingerprint.. (FirebaseHttpClient.h)
